Images
======

The **Images** module allows you to specify the location of files to be
analyzed by the pipeline; setting this module correctly is the first
step in creating a new project in CellProfiler. These files can be
located on your hard drive, on a networked computer elsewhere, or
accessible with a URL. You can also provide rules to specify only those
files that you want analyzed out of a larger collection (for example,
from a folder containing both images for analysis and non-image files
that should be disregarded).

What is a “digital image”?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *digital image* is a set of numbers arranged into a two-dimensional
format of rows and columns; a pixel refers to the row/column location of
a particular point in the image. Pixels in grayscale or monochrome
(black/white) images contain a single intensity value, whereas in color
images, each pixel contains a red, green, and blue (RGB) triplet of
intensity values. Additionally, the term image can be used as short-hand
for an image sequence, that is, an image collection such as a time-lapse
series (2-D + *t*), confocal Z-stacks (3-D), etc.

CellProfiler can read a wide variety of image formats by using a library
called Bio-Formats; see `here`_ for the formats available. Some image
formats are better than others for use in image analysis. Some are
`“lossy”`_ (information is lost in the conversion to the format) like
most JPG/JPEG files; others are `“lossless”`_ (no image information is
lost). For image analysis purposes, a lossless format like TIF or PNG is
recommended.

What do I need as input?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most straightforward way to provide image files to the **Images**
module is to simply drag-and-drop them on the file list panel (the blank
space indicated by the text “Drop files and folders here”).

.. image:: {IMG_PANEL_BLANK}
   :width: 100%

Using the file explorer tool of your choice (e.g., Explorer in Windows,
Finder in Mac), you can drag-and-drop individual files and/or entire
folders into this panel. You can also right-click in the File list panel
to bring up a file selection window to browse for individual files; on
the Mac, folders can be drag-and-dropped from this window and you can
select multiple files using Ctrl-A (Windows) or Cmd-A (Mac).

.. image:: {IMG_PANEL_FILLED}
   :width: 100%

Right-clicking on the file list panel will provide a context menu with
options to modify the file list:

-  *Show Selected Image:* Selecting this option (or double-clicking on
   the file) will open the image in a new window.
-  *Remove From List:* Removes the selected file or folder from the
   list. Note that this does not remove the file/folder from the hard
   drive.
-  *Remove Unavailable Files:* Refresh the list by checking for
   existence of file. Note that this does not remove the files from the
   hard drive.
-  *Browse For Images:* Use a dialog box to select an image file (though
   drag-and-drop is recommended).
-  *Refresh:* Shown only if folder is selected. Refresh the list of
   files from the folder. Files that were manually removed from the list
   for that folder are restored.
-  *Expand All Folders:* Expand all trees shown in the file list panel.
-  *Collapse All Folders:* Collapse all folder trees shown in the file
   list panel.
-  *Clear File List:* Remove all files/folders in the file list panel.
   You will be prompted for confirmation beforehand. Note that this does
   not remove the files from the hard drive.

How do I configure the module?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a subset of files that you want to analyze from the full
listing shown in the panel, you can filter the files according to a set
of rules. This is useful in cases such as:

-  You have dragged a folder of images onto the file list panel, but the
   folder contains images you want to analyze along with non-image files
   that you want to disregard.
-  You have dragged a folder of images onto the file list panel, but the
   folder contains the images from one experiment that you want to
   process along with images from another experiment that you want to
   ignore for now.

You may specify as many rules as necessary to define the desired list of
images.

After you have filtered the file list, press the “Apply” button to
update the view of the file list. You can also toggle the “Show file
excluded by filters” box to modify the display of the files:

-  Checking this box will show all the files in the list, with the files
   that have been filtered out shown as grayed-out entries.
-  Not checking this box will only show the files in the list that pass
   the filter(s).

What do I get as output?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The final product of the **Images** module is a file list in which any
files that are not intended for further processing have been removed,
whether manually or using filtering. This list will be used when
collecting metadata (if desired) and when assembling the image sets in
NamesAndTypes. The list can be filtered further in NamesAndTypes to
specify, for example, that a subset of these images represents a
particular wavelength.

The **Images** module will pass all the files specified in the file list
panel downstream to have a meaningful name assigned to it (so other
modules can access it) or optionally, to define the relationships
between images and associated metadata. Enabling file filtering will
allow you to specify a subset of the files from the file list panel by
defining rules to filter the files. This approach is useful if, for
example, you drag-and-dropped a folder onto the file list panel which
contains a mixture of images that you want to analyze and other files
that you want to ignore.

Several options are available for this setting:

-  *{FILTER_CHOICE_NONE}:* Do not enable filtering; all files in the
   File list panel will be passed to downstream modules for processing.
   This option can be selected if you are sure that only images are
   specified in the list.
-  *{FILTER_CHOICE_IMAGES}:* Only image files will be passed to
   downstream modules. The permissible image formats are provided by a
   library called Bio-Formats; see `here`_ for the formats available.
-  *{FILTER_CHOICE_CUSTOM}:* Specify custom rules for selecting a
   subset of the files from the File list panel. This approach is useful
   if, for example, you drag-and-dropped a folder onto the File list
   panel which contains a mixture of images that you want to analyze and
   other files that you want to ignore.
